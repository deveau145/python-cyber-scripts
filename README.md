# 🐍 Python for Cybersecurity Scripts

> This repository contains small Python projects, tools, and automation scripts built to strengthen my security skills and support SOC/GRC operations.

---

## 🧠 Purpose
These scripts support hands-on learning from:
- David Bombal’s *52 Weeks of Python*
- Packt books like *Python for Security and Networking*
- Security automation use cases (SIEM parsing, log analysis, etc.)

---

## 🔧 Example Scripts
| Script Name         | Purpose                             | Status  |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|---------|
| `ping_sweeper.py`   | ICMP ping scan across subnet         | Planned |
| `log_parser.py`     | Parse security event logs            | Planned |
| `url_checker.py`    | Check if URL is live or blacklisted  | Planned |
| `hash_cracker.py`   | Brute force hash matching demo       | Planned |

---

## 🧪 Development Goals
- Use `argparse`, `requests`, `socket`, and other stdlib tools
- Build modular scripts with comments and error handling
- Use GitHub Issues to track bugs or new features

> This repo will grow as I continue working through my Python and security learning path. Contributions or forks welcome!
